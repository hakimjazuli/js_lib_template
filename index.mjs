 * WARNING!!!
 * - this library uses single-named export on same-named file
 * - don't use it on a production or published library directly without checking any behaviour
 * that might not suited to your library paradigm;
 * - it also directly messes with `relativeFilePath`
 * >	- generate single exporter
 * - and `relativeFolderPath`
 * >	- generate `.d.ts` OR `.d.mts`
 * - so again unless you are familiar with this library output, don't run it on prod or published
